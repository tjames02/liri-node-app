In this assignment, I made a LIRI bot. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI searches Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

To retrieve the data that powers this app, LIRI sends requests using the axios package to the Bands in Town, Spotify, and OMDB APIs.

The following Node packages are used:
Node-Spotify-API
Axios (grabs data from the OMDB API and the Bands In Town API)
Moment
DotEnv
